- IMAGENET - 
    - is a dataset of images , it has 14 million images , it is a very large dataset
    - it is used for image classification , image recognition , object detection , etc
    - it has 1000 classes of images , each class has 1000 images , so 1000 x 1000 = 1 million images
    - it is used for training deep learning models
    - the classes are like
        - cat
        - dog
        - car
        - truck
        - etc

- MS ResNet - means Microsoft ResNet
    - ResNet - means Residual Network
    - it was better than VGGNet, AlexNet, etc and it won the ImageNet competition in 2015
    - it outperformed humans in image classification

- Hubel and Wiesel Experiment
    - they were neuroscientists
    - they were studying the visual cortex of cats
    - they were trying to understand how the visual cortex of cats works
    - they found that the visual cortex of cats has neurons that respond to edges of different orientations (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, etc)
    - for example, there are neurons that respond to horizontal edges, there are neurons that respond to vertical edges, etc

    - it says different parts of the image are processed by different parts of the network
