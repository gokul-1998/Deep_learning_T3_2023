## 2.10 Representation power of Multilayer Network of Sigmoid Neurons: 2D functions

- what is we have more than one input?

- let orange points be the place where we find oil and blue points be the place where we dont find oil.
- for all the blue points its predicting 0, and for all the orange points its predicting 1., see the below figure.

    - for this we want a 2d tower
- ![](2023-10-09-07-06-59.png)
- w1 controls the slope in left to right direction

- w2 controls the slope in up to down direction

- b helps in movement along the direction
- if we increase both w1 and w2, something interesting happens, it rotates in clock or anti clock wise direction.

- Now lets try to construct a tower in 3d

- with h11 and h12
- ![](2023-10-09-07-09-14.png)
- subtract both to get a tower function

- ![](2023-10-09-07-11-48.png)
    - we have played with w1 and w3, and kept w2 and w4 =0
    - we want a closed tower on all the sides

    - ![](2023-10-09-07-15-08.png)
    - the walls are closed here
    - in the middle both are 1 so if we add them up , we will,get 2, an elevation will appear   
    - ![](2023-10-09-07-19-21.png)
    - the structure sitting at the top is closed from all sides
    - we have 3 levels of output
        - 0,1,2 and we want to retain things which are greater than 1
        - so we pass in to a sigmoid neuron with threshold 1,
        - ![](2023-10-09-07-22-34.png)
- finally we constructed a 2d tower with a network like this,
