## L8.1 Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks

- What is convolutional operation?
- What is Max Pooling?
- What is a full CNN look like?
- How to compute the number of parameters in a CNN?
- Where is the density of parameters higher in a CNN?
- Few standard CNN
  - LeNet-5
  - AlexNet

  - ResNet-50
  - Inception
- What is the building blocks, and the intuition behind them?
  - Residual block
  - Inception block
- Number of parameters , how do they compare with eachother and their performance on imagenet dataset
- How do you visualize CNN
- Backpropagation in CNN
- Guided backpropagation   
- Understand for which kind of images does a CNN fire, 
- There is a particular neuron in a CNN, that fire
